# Sequence-Detector
This Verilog project is to present a full Verilog code for Sequence Detector using Moore FSM. A Verilog Testbench for the Moore FSM sequence detector is also provided for simulation. 
The Moore FSM keeps detecting a binary sequence from a digital input and the output of the FSM goes high only when a "1011" sequence is detected. The state diagram of the Moore FSM for the sequence detector is shown in the following figure.
